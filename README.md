# tree-counter

Wanted to see if I could solve this problem as proposed [on Twitter by vikhyatk](https://x.com/vikhyatk/status/1873033432705712304).

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.42. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
